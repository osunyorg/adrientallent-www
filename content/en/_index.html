    <p>  <br>On December 15, 2025, I defended my PhD thesis at Sorbonne University (Science, Norms, and Democracy Laboratory SND - UMR8011) on the ethical and political consequences of the massive use of data by states and companies and its processing by artificial intelligence systems for governance purposes. I am particularly interested in the possibilities for democratic renewal (participation, decentralization, etc.) in the digital context. In short, I am questioning the notion of the social contract in the digital age. During my thesis, I benefited from a three-year CIFRE doctoral contract with SNCF Réseau, which allowed me to combine my theoretical and philosophical interest in digital technology and AI with a practical perspective. </p>  <p>   <br>Doctor in Political Philosophy and <br>ethics, ethic teacher in digital ethics and AI, and writer, <br>is currently preparing a philosophy thesis at Sorbonne University on <br>the ethical and political consequences of the massive use of <br>Member States and enterprises and their processing by <br>artificial intelligence systems for governance purposes.
